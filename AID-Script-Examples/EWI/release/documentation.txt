Extended World Information (EWI) aims at providing the user with more flexible interactions with World Information.
To achieve this, the user is instructed to place bracket-encapsulated attribute short-hands into the keys of a worldEntries element.

A quick example of what that looks like, if convoluting it as far as possible, the keys can be: '$you, $wield|equip|unsheathe, $branch|stick|staff|wand|scepter, [f=3armcedw=100]'
The '$' symbol is to prevent the native world information processing from duplicating the entry whilst '|' is a symbol signifying 'OR' (Used with the 'e' tag)

In this initial example, the entry would activate if the context contains 'you' in addition to either of 'branch/stick/staff'.
It would then process the content of the entry in the following manner:

[f] - frontMemory, a transient string appended to the end of every output.
    [f] takes an optional integer value for its assignment that determines how often it can be activated, e.g [f=3] means that it can at max be activated once every three turns.

[a] - authorsNote, a transient, bracket-encapsulated notation roughly three line-breaks into context.
[r] - revealEntry, if the entry was hidden it would now be revealed to the user.
[m] - mediumMemory, a transient string inserted two line-breaks into the context.
[c] - context/backMemory, imitates the normal world entry behavior, but is placed after memory instead of before.
[e] - Every match, requires that all of the keys are present for it to activate. In conjunction with '|' (OR) this becomes a whole lot more flexible.
[d] - descriptor, adds a transient, parenthesized descriptor to the last mention of a valid key. e.g if the entry states 'A boomstick of doom.' then the AI would see e.g 'stick (A boomstick of doom)'

[w] - weight, adds a weight for sorting purposes as to circumvent the natural order of entries. 
    [w] requires an assignment of an integer value e.g [w=1000], non-assigned entries are considered a weight of zero and should be sorted by their creation order.
    A higher [w] value ensures that it's positioned more recent than those with no or lower value, thus increasing the chance of it being relevant.

The various attributes can be mixed and matched as you see fit and none are necessarily dependent on each other, although prefixing your keys with '$' to avoid duplication is recommended.
